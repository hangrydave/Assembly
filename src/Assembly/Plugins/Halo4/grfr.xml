	<comment title="GROUNDED FRICTION">Defines friction to be applied to grounded things (rolling or sliding) relative to the time they've been rolling/sliding. Friction of 1.0 will stop them completely in a single tick. Friction of 0.0 is the same as no friction at all. The on-ground timer used to access this graph resets if the object leaves the ground for any period of time (bounces, is blown off the ground, etc).
FOR EXAMPLE: Set up the graph as a "Curve", set the range to 0-1 (using the boxes at the top and bottom of the right-hand side of the graph), and set the domain min and max to 0 and 5, respectively. Set the maximum slope for friction to 90 (vertical walls). The in-game result is that any object using this grounded friction will have friction of 0 (no friction) applied the instant they stop bouncing and start rolling/sliding, and that friction will ramp up (using the curve you provided) to 1 over the course of 5 seconds. After 5 seconds of sliding/rolling, the object will come to a stop, no matter what (even if it's sliding down an 85 degree slope, because you set the maximum slope for friction to 90).</comment>

Use a very large number to disable (e.g. 10000.0)." />
